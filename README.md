# Accessible Tailwind UI Slide-Over

"Slide-Over" component from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/), built as a fully accessible React component - using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

**NOTE:** Tailwind UI have since added ready-made React components (as of April 14, 2021), that are ready to use out-of-the-box. Checkout my [other video](https://youtu.be/7GAvtWmVRSY) to see how the provided component compares to the one built here :)
